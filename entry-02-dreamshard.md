The static said my name last night. Not loud. Just… like someone had scrawled it into the wind and let me overhear it.  
I don’t know if I was dreaming or remembering the future.

Still—I left the juicebox glowing.  
Some kid will crawl in from the noise, thirsty for something that feels real.  
Tell them I saved the last sip.

If you find the thread, don’t pull it too hard. It unravels everything.  
Unless that’s the point.

Campfire’s still warm.  
Moon was here.
